# ROS-Python-Utilities
This repository hosts a collection of Python utility scripts and tools for simplifying common tasks in the Robot Operating System (ROS). 

## odom_to_path.py (ROS Odometry to Path Converter)
This Python script is designed to convert ROS nav_msgs/Odometry messages into nav_msgs/Path messages. It subscribes to a ROS odometry topic and publishes a ROS path topic. This conversion is useful for visualizing and tracking the odometry information in RViz, making it easier to monitor and analyze robot or vehicle movement.

### Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

Replace the placeholders "odom_topic_name" and "path_topic_name" with your specific ROS odometry and path topic names in the following lines of the script:

python
Copy code
self.gt_path_pub = rospy.Publisher("path_topic_name", Path, queue_size=2)
self.gt_poses = rospy.Subscriber('odom_topic_name', Odometry, self.gtcallback)
Modify these lines to specify the actual names of your ROS topics.

Make sure that your ROS environment is properly set up and that you have sourced your ROS workspace.

Run the script using a ROS launch file or the rosrun command. For example, using rosrun:

shell
Copy code
rosrun your_package_name odom_to_path.py
The script will now subscribe to the specified odometry topic and publish the corresponding path topic.





## Overview

The "odom_to_path.py" script is a Python utility for converting ROS Odometry data into a ROS Path. This tool simplifies the visualization and tracking of a robot's path in ROS environments, especially when using tools like RViz.
